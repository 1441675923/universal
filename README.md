Universal Number Arithmetic

# How to build

The universal numbers software library is built with cmake. Install the latest cmake (https://cmake.org/download).
Other prerequisites are BOOST and MTL.

Download and install BOOST: [boost](http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
Download and install MTL4: [MTL4](http://simunova.com/node/145)

Create a CMAKE variable for Boost_INCLUDE_DIR where you installed BOOST (for example: Boost_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/boost_1_65_1).
Create a CMAKE variable for MTL_DIR where you installed MTL (for example: MTL_DIR=/usr/local/mtl/share/mtl).

Now we are ready to build the universal library.

```
> git clone https://github.com/stillwater-sc/universal
> cd universal/build
> cmake ..
> make
> make test

```

# Background information

Universal numbers, unums for short, are for expressing real numbers, and ranges of real numbers. 
There are two modes of operation, selectable by the programmer, _posit_ mode, and _valid_ mode.

In _posit_ mode, a unum behaves much like a floating-point number of fixed size, 
rounding to the nearest expressible value if the result of a calculation is not expressible exactly.
A posit offers more accuracy and a larger dynamic range than floats with the same number of bits.

In _valid_ mode, a unum represents a range of real numbers and can be used to rigorously bound answers 
much like interval arithmetic does.

The unum format is a public domain specification, and there are a collection of web resources that
manage information and discussions around the use of unums.

# Goals of the library

This library is a bit-level arithmetic reference implementation of the evolving unum III (posit and valid) standard.
The goal is to provide a faithful posit arithmetic layer for any C/C++/Python environment.

As a reference library, there is extensive test infrastructure to validate the arithmetic, and there is a host
of utilities to become familiar with the internal workings of posits and valids.

We want to provide a complete unum library, and we are looking for contributors to finish the Type I and II unum implementations.

# Contributing to universal

We are happy to accept pull requests via GitHub. The only requirement that we would like PR's to adhere to
is that all the test cases pass, so that we know the new code isn't breaking any functionality.

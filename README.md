Universal Number Arithmetic

# How to build

The universal numbers software library is built with cmake. 
Install the latest cmake [cmake](https://cmake.org/download).

The library is a pure template library without any further dependencies.

Now we are ready to build the universal library.

```
> git clone https://github.com/stillwater-sc/universal
> cd universal/build
> cmake ..
> make
> make test

```

# Background information

Universal numbers, unums for short, are for expressing real numbers, and ranges of real numbers. 
There are two modes of operation, selectable by the programmer, _posit_ mode, and _valid_ mode.

In _posit_ mode, a unum behaves much like a floating-point number of fixed size, 
rounding to the nearest expressible value if the result of a calculation is not expressible exactly.
A posit offers more accuracy and a larger dynamic range than floats with the same number of bits.

In _valid_ mode, a unum represents a range of real numbers and can be used to rigorously bound answers 
much like interval arithmetic does.

The unum format is a public domain specification, and there are a collection of web resources that
manage information and discussions around the use of unums.

# Issues with IEEE Floats
1. **Wasted Bit Patterns** - 32-bit IEEE floating point has around sixteen million ways to represent Not-A-Number
(NaN) while 64-bit floating point has nine quadrillion. A NaN is an exception value for invalid operations such as division by zero.
2. **Mathematically Incorrect** - The format specifies two zeroes - a negative and positive zero - which have different behaviors. - Loss of associative and distributive law due to rounding after each operation
3. **Overflows to ± inf and underflows to 0** - Overflowing to ± inf increases the relative error by an infinite factor, while underflowing to 0 loses sign information.
4. **Complicated Circuitry** - Denormalized floating point numbers have a hidden bit of 0 instead of 1. This creates
a host of special handling requirements that complicate compliant hardware implementations.
5. **No Gradual Overflow and Fixed Accuracy** - If accuracy is defined as the number of significand bits, IEEE
floating point have fixed accuracy for all numbers except denormalized numbers because the number of signficand
digits is fixed. Denormalized numbers are characterized by a decreased number of significand digits when the value approaches zero as a result of having a zero hidden bit. Denormalized numbers fill the underflow gap (i.e.
the gap between zero and the least non-zero values). The counterpart for gradual underflow is gradual overflow
which does not exist in IEEE floating points.

# Advantages of Posits
1. **Economical** - No bit patterns are redundant. There is one representation for infinity denoted as ± inf and zero.
All other bit patterns are valid distinct non-zero real numbers. ± inf serves as a replacement for NaN.
2. **Mathematical Elegant** - There is only one representation for zero.
3. **Gradual Underflow and Overflow** - The number of significand digits are not fixed in posits. In fact, a greater magnitude exponent, automatically reduces the number of significand digits which allows for both gradual overflow and underflow.
4. **Simpler Circuitry** - There are only two special cases, Not a Real and Zero. No denormalized numbers.
5. **Tapered Accuracy** - Tapered accuracy is when values with small exponent have more digits of accuracy and values with large exponents have less digits of accuracy. This concept was first introduced by Morris (1971) in his paper ”Tapered Floating Point: A New Floating-Point Representation”.

# Goals of the library

This library is a bit-level arithmetic reference implementation of the evolving unum III (posit and valid) standard.
The goal is to provide a faithful posit arithmetic layer for any C/C++/Python environment.

As a reference library, there is extensive test infrastructure to validate the arithmetic, and there is a host
of utilities to become familiar with the internal workings of posits and valids.

We want to provide a complete unum library, and we are looking for contributors to finish the Type I and II unum implementations.

# Contributing to universal

We are happy to accept pull requests via GitHub. The only requirement that we would like PR's to adhere to
is that all the test cases pass, so that we know the new code isn't breaking any functionality.
